    "# Custom Instructions: The System Prompt of ChatGPT & LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This content explains ChatGPT's \"Custom Instructions\" feature, a powerful tool that allows users to provide persistent information about themselves (e.g., location, profession, interests) and specify how they want ChatGPT to respond (e.g., formality, length, tone). By effectively modifying the underlying system prompt, these instructions enable ChatGPT to generate more personalized, relevant, and consistently formatted outputs, thereby saving users significant time and enhancing the efficiency of their interactions for both casual use and specialized tasks like data science projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Simplifies Prompt Engineering:** Custom Instructions allow users to pre-load ChatGPT with ongoing context about themselves and their desired response style, reducing the need to repeat such information in every prompt. This is highly beneficial for data scientists who require consistent and tailored outputs for their analyses.\n",
    "-   **Two-Part Configuration:** The feature is structured into two main sections: 1) Information about the user (e.g., \"Where are you based?\", \"What do you do for work?\", \"What are your hobbies and interests?\", \"What are some goals you have?\") and 2) Preferences for ChatGPT's responses (e.g., \"How formal or casual should ChatGPT be?\", \"How long or short should responses generally be?\", \"How do you want to be addressed?\"). This systematic approach facilitates comprehensive personalization.\n",
    "-   **Acts as a Modifiable System Prompt:** Custom Instructions function by giving ChatGPT persistent contextual information, similar to how a system prompt guides an LLM's behavior. More context generally leads to better and more relevant outputs, a key principle in effective LLM interaction.\n",
    "-   **Enables Personalized and Context-Aware Outputs:** By providing details like location, profession, or specific project goals, users can receive responses that are more directly applicable to their needs (e.g., local recommendations, code relevant to their expertise, or advice aligned with their project objectives). For data science, this means the AI can better understand the domain-specific context of queries.\n",
    "-   **Controls Output Format and Style:** Users can direct ChatGPT to maintain a certain level of formality, keep responses concise, present information in tables, or adopt a neutral stance. This consistency is valuable for tasks like generating reports, documentation, or structured data summaries.\n",
    "-   **Supports Shortcut Creation for Efficiency:** An advanced use case is defining shortcuts, where a simple input (e.g., typing \"a\") can trigger a more complex, predefined request (e.g., \"give me five alternatives\"). This can automate repetitive queries or brainstorming, boosting productivity in data exploration or analysis workflows.\n",
    "-   **Persistent Across New Chats:** Once enabled, custom instructions are automatically applied to every new chat session. This ensures a consistent and context-aware AI assistant without the user needing to re-establish preferences each time, saving considerable effort for frequent users.\n",
    "-   **Enhances Large Project Assistance:** Users can detail large-scale projects (e.g., \"I am building a large application and need extensive Python code for the remaining 700 pages\") to receive highly focused and relevant coding or strategic assistance. This is directly applicable to data scientists managing complex, multi-stage analytical projects.\n",
    "-   **Leverages OpenAI's Guidance:** The feature itself provides cues and suggestions from OpenAI on what information is useful to include. This helps users make the most of custom instructions by following best practices identified by the model's creators.\n",
    "-   **Strong Recommendation for Use:** The speaker, despite deactivating the feature for demonstration purposes in a course, strongly advises users to enable and utilize custom instructions to improve their ChatGPT experience, underscoring their practical utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **System Prompt Influence**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** The \"system prompt\" is a foundational set of instructions an LLM receives before user interaction, defining its persona, scope, and response style. Custom Instructions allow users to effectively add to or modify parts of this system prompt, offering a persistent way to guide the AI's behavior beyond individual prompts. Understanding this mechanism clarifies why custom instructions lead to more consistently tailored and relevant responses.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** For data scientists, customizing the system prompt via Custom Instructions can mean setting up ChatGPT to consistently understand their specific domain (e.g., bioinformatics, financial modeling), preferred programming languages (Python with a focus on pandas, scikit-learn), desired output formats for reports, or even a specific analytical approach. This reduces repetitive setup and ensures outputs align better with professional needs.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Exploring general prompt engineering principles, such as role-playing prompts (e.g., \"act as a senior data scientist\"), few-shot prompting (providing examples within the prompt), and meta-prompting (instructing the AI on how to behave as an assistant), would be beneficial. These techniques offer different ways to provide context and guide LLM behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Shortcut Creation for Task Automation**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** This application of Custom Instructions allows users to define simple textual triggers (e.g., \"explain_code\") that expand into more detailed requests (e.g., \"Explain the following Python code snippet, focusing on its purpose, inputs, outputs, and potential edge cases, and provide an example of its use.\"). It essentially creates macros or aliases within the chat interface, streamlining repetitive interactions.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** Data scientists often perform recurring tasks such as requesting code explanations, generating boilerplate code for visualizations, asking for summaries of findings in a specific format, or seeking alternative approaches to a problem. Shortcuts can automate these common queries, saving time and ensuring consistency. For example, typing \"critique_model\" could instruct ChatGPT to analyze a model's performance based on predefined criteria important to the user.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** This relates to scripting, macro creation in software (like Excel VBA or text editor macros), and the general principles of task automation. Understanding how to break down repetitive tasks into definable, triggerable actions is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific dataset or project could benefit from Custom Instructions that define your role as a \"Data Scientist specializing in anomaly detection for cybersecurity logs\"? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* A project involving the analysis of network traffic logs to identify unusual patterns indicative of security breaches would greatly benefit, as ChatGPT could be pre-set to prioritize cybersecurity-relevant anomalies and suggest appropriate detection algorithms.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the benefit of \"Custom Instructions\" for maintaining a consistent persona to a junior colleague, using one concrete example? Keep it under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* By setting Custom Instructions to \"Always respond as a helpful data analysis mentor and explain concepts suitable for a beginner,\" ChatGPT will consistently adopt this persona, making its explanations more accessible and patient, even if your direct prompts are brief or technical.\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** Given that Custom Instructions allow for persistent context, what related technique for managing even larger, project-specific knowledge bases with an LLM should you explore next, and why?\n",
    "    * *Answer:* Exploring Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) would be a logical next step because RAG allows an LLM to access and incorporate information from external, custom knowledge bases (like project documentation or specific datasets) dynamically during generation, providing even more specific and detailed context than what Custom Instructions alone can offer for large-scale projects.\n",

    "# Chain of Thought Prompting: CAGR in the S+P 500\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video explains Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting, a technique designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities and accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) when tackling problems that require multiple steps. CoT can be implemented either by providing few-shot examples that explicitly demonstrate a step-by-step thinking process to reach a solution, or by using a simple zero-shot instruction like \"Let's think step by step\" to encourage the model to generate its own logical sequence of reasoning before providing an answer; both methods aim to improve performance on complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Core Concept of Chain of Thought (CoT):** CoT prompting guides LLMs to articulate a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps before delivering a final answer. This method helps models emulate a more human-like, deliberate thinking process, significantly boosting accuracy for tasks involving arithmetic, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic logic.\n",
    "-   **Two Primary CoT Approaches:**\n",
    "    * **Few-Shot CoT:** This involves including examples in the prompt that detail not only the question and answer but also the explicit step-by-step reasoning to arrive at that answer. The LLM then learns to apply this demonstrated reasoning pattern to new, analogous questions.\n",
    "    * **Zero-Shot CoT:** This is achieved by simply appending an instructional phrase, such as \"Let's think step by step,\" to the user's query. This prompts the model to generate its own chain of reasoning without needing prior explicit examples in the prompt.\n",
    "-   **Improved Reasoning via Semantic Association:** By exposing the LLM to the methodology of breaking down a problem (in few-shot CoT) or by instructing it to create such a breakdown (in zero-shot CoT), the model can more effectively activate and link relevant knowledge and logical constructs from its training. This \"semantic association\" helps bridge the gap between the problem statement and the solution steps.\n",
    "-   **Enhanced Complex Problem-Solving:** CoT enables LLMs to better handle problems that require multi-step deduction. Instead of attempting an immediate, and potentially incorrect, answer, the model is guided to follow a coherent logical pathway, thereby increasing the probability of a correct and well-reasoned solution. This is crucial for data science tasks involving intricate calculations or logical inferences.\n",
    "-   **Increased Output Transparency and Debuggability:** When an LLM outputs its chain of thought, users gain visibility into the reasoning process. This transparency makes it easier to understand how the model derived its answer and to identify any logical fallacies or errors in its steps, which is vital for validating AI-generated insights in data-driven decision-making.\n",
    "-   **Efficacy of \"Let's think step by step\":** This straightforward phrase serves as a potent trigger for zero-shot CoT. It nudges the model to externalize its internal computational or reasoning process, often leading to more accurate and reliable results compared to when it provides an answer directly.\n",
    "-   **Broad Applicability Across LLMs:** The principles of CoT prompting are generally effective across various LLMs, though the degree of improvement may depend on the specific model's architecture and training. Even advanced models can benefit from explicit CoT for particularly complex or nuanced tasks.\n",
    "-   **Demonstration with Compound Interest Calculation:** The video illustrates CoT using a compound annual growth rate problem. While a sophisticated LLM like ChatGPT might sometimes solve it correctly without explicit CoT (possibly due to its advanced training), using \"Let's think step by step\" makes the methodical approach more deliberate and thus more reliable.\n",
    "-   **Prioritizing Reliability Over Chance:** Relying on an LLM to \"get lucky\" and correctly reason through complex problems is not a robust strategy for professional use. CoT offers a more structured and dependable method to guide the LLM, critical for data professionals who require high accuracy.\n",
    "-   **Model-Generated Reasoning Paths:** In zero-shot CoT, the model itself constructs the \"examples\" of thought processes by articulating its steps based on the instruction to think systematically. This empowers the model to autonomously forge its path to the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Few-Shot Chain of Thought Prompting**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** It effectively \"teaches\" the model how to reason by providing concrete examples. Instead of just question-answer pairs (standard few-shot), it uses question-reasoning_steps-answer triplets. This allows the LLM to discern and replicate the underlying pattern of thinking required for a specific class of problems, improving its ability to generalize to similar, unseen problems.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** In data science, this can be used to guide an LLM in performing complex multi-step analytical tasks. For instance, to teach an LLM how to formulate a data analysis plan: given a dataset description and a research question, show it examples of how to outline the necessary steps (e.g., data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical modeling, result interpretation). This helps the LLM generate similar comprehensive plans for new research questions.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** This builds upon standard few-shot learning and in-context learning. Understanding how LLMs perform pattern recognition and generalize from limited examples is crucial. Exploring different structuring methods for the reasoning steps within the examples can also be beneficial.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Zero-Shot Chain of Thought Prompting**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** It provides an accessible and low-effort method to elicit step-by-step reasoning from LLMs without needing to craft detailed examples. Simple instructions like \"Let's think step by step\" can unlock an LLM's inherent, but sometimes latent, ability to perform sequential reasoning, which it might not activate by default for complex or ambiguous queries.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** A data scientist can use this to get a quick yet structured and reasoned answer to a complex query. For example: \"I have a dataset with customer demographics and purchase history. What are the potential biases if I use this to build a product recommendation engine, and how might I mitigate them? Let's think step by step.\" This encourages the LLM to break down the problem, consider different facets, and present a logically structured output.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** This is related to instructional prompting and understanding LLM steerability. Investigating how LLMs interpret and respond to direct commands for specific cognitive tasks (e.g., \"explain,\" \"compare,\" \"critique\") and output structures is relevant. Exploring other \"zero-shot\" capabilities, like zero-shot classification or summarization, can provide a broader context.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Role of Semantic Association in CoT Effectiveness**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** The transcript posits that CoT is effective because it helps the model \"associate its math knowledge a lot better.\" When an LLM is prompted to lay out explicit steps, it sequentially activates and connects relevant concepts, operations, and factual knowledge (semantic fields or clusters) within its vast internal knowledge graph. This structured activation is more effective than trying to retrieve and synthesize all necessary information in a single pass.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** When asking an LLM to generate a complex Python script for statistical analysis or to draft a detailed project proposal, CoT encourages a methodical construction. For instance, in coding, it would consider imports, data loading, preprocessing, analysis functions, and output generation sequentially, ensuring that dependencies and logical flow are better maintained. This helps in reducing errors and improving the coherence of the generated output.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Understanding knowledge representation in LLMs (e.g., vector embeddings, transformer attention mechanisms) and how these models perform information retrieval and multi-hop reasoning can provide deeper insights. Topics like graph traversal algorithms and cognitive psychology theories on human problem-solving (which often involve breaking problems into parts) can offer analogous perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Which specific data interpretation challenge, such as explaining the results of a complex machine learning model to a non-technical stakeholder, could have benefited from prompting an LLM with \"Let's explain this step by step as if to a CEO\"? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* Explaining the key drivers behind a customer churn model's predictions to an executive team would benefit, as this CoT prompt would encourage the LLM to break down complex statistical relationships into a clear, sequential, and business-relevant narrative.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain \"Zero-Shot Chain of Thought prompting\" to a new data science intern using a simple analogy related to cooking? Keep it under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* It's like asking a chef for a complex recipe; instead of them just giving you the final dish name, you say \"Let's think step by step,\" and they'll list out all the ingredients and cooking stages, making it easier to understand and replicate.\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** After grasping Chain of Thought, what related prompting technique that involves the LLM generating multiple reasoning paths and then selecting the best one should you explore next, and why?\n",
    "    * *Answer:* Exploring \"Self-Consistency\" or \"Tree of Thoughts (ToT)\" prompting would be a valuable next step because these techniques build upon CoT by having the LLM generate multiple diverse reasoning paths (multiple chains of thought) for a problem and then use a selection or voting mechanism to determine the most likely correct answer, further improving robustness and accuracy, especially for complex decision-making tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Self consistency prompting in Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video introduces Self-Consistency prompting, a technique that improves the reliability of answers from Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging multiple responses to the same query. Presented as an advancement over Chain of Thought prompting, it involves running a prompt several times, collecting the varied outputs (each potentially a result of a different reasoning path), and then selecting the most frequently occurring answer as the most trustworthy one, thereby enhancing accuracy for complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Enhancement to Chain of Thought:** Self-consistency is positioned as a subsequent step or an enhancement to Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting. It typically involves generating multiple diverse CoT reasoning paths for the same problem and then identifying the most frequent resulting answer. This is valuable for data scientists seeking to validate complex analyses generated via CoT.\n",
    "-   **Core Process: Repetition and Aggregation:** The fundamental method involves submitting the identical input prompt to an LLM multiple times (e.g., in new chat sessions or through repeated generation requests) and systematically collecting all the generated outputs. This allows for a broader sampling of the model's potential solution space.\n",
    "-   **Majority Vote for Increased Accuracy:** The final, most reliable answer is determined by a \"majority vote\" – identifying the output that appears most frequently among the collected responses. This approach helps to filter out less probable, idiosyncratic, or erroneous answers that a single generation might produce.\n",
    "-   **Leverages and Manages Output Variability:** LLMs inherently produce varied responses to identical prompts due to their stochastic sampling during generation. Self-consistency turns this variability into an advantage by exploring multiple reasoning pathways and then converging on the most commonly derived solution. This is crucial when an initial AI-generated insight requires robust validation.\n",
    "-   **Indicates Problem Complexity or Ambiguity:** If the collected outputs show high variance with no clear, consistent answer emerging, it can signal that the original prompt was too difficult, poorly formulated, or that the model lacks strong conviction for that specific type of problem. This provides diagnostic feedback for refining the query.\n",
    "-   **Practical Verification Tool:** Self-consistency is recommended when a user is uncertain about the correctness or quality of a single LLM output. Re-running the prompt multiple times offers a straightforward method to increase confidence in the chosen answer, which is especially pertinent for critical decisions based on LLM outputs in data science or research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Self-Consistency as an Enhancement to Chain of Thought**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** While Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting guides an LLM to produce a single, reasoned pathway to an answer, self-consistency advances this by generating *multiple diverse reasoning paths* (often using CoT for each individual path) for the same problem. It then selects the answer that appears most frequently among these varied derivations. This leverages the insight that multiple valid reasoning approaches can lead to a correct solution, and the most common outcome across these diverse paths is likely the most robust.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** For complex data science tasks, such as interpreting ambiguous data patterns, generating hypotheses for A/B testing, or performing multi-step calculations where errors can easily propagate, relying on a single CoT might yield a plausible but potentially flawed result. By prompting the LLM to generate several different CoT solutions and applying self-consistency, a data scientist can achieve greater confidence in the final selected answer, as it has been corroborated through multiple independent lines of reasoning.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** Ensemble methods in traditional machine learning, such as bagging (e.g., Random Forests) where multiple models are trained and their predictions are aggregated, share a similar foundational philosophy of improving robustness through diversity and consensus. More advanced prompting techniques like \"Tree of Thoughts\" (ToT) or \"Graph of Thoughts\" (GoT), which systematically explore and evaluate multiple reasoning paths, are also relevant extensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** For which specific data modeling task, where an LLM might suggest different model architectures or hyperparameter sets, could self-consistency be applied to choose a more robust starting point? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* When using an LLM to suggest initial architectures for a neural network to solve a complex image classification problem, self-consistency could help by running the prompt multiple times and selecting the architecture components or design principles that appear most frequently in the suggestions.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the value of self-consistency to a junior colleague who is frustrated because asking the LLM the same complex question multiple times yields slightly different step-by-step explanations? Keep it under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* Explain that these variations are normal for LLMs; self-consistency uses this by collecting all those different explanations and then picking the final answer that shows up most often, making it more likely to be the correct one because multiple \"thought processes\" led to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generated knowledge prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video explains \"Knowledge Creation Prompting\" (also referred to as Knowledge Generation), a straightforward technique to improve the quality of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs). The method involves first asking the LLM a general question to generate information about a specific topic (e.g., \"Tell me about spiders\"); this output then enriches the current chat's context, effectively \"priming\" the LLM with relevant information and enhancing its ability to handle subsequent, more specific prompts on that topic due to improved semantic association.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Two-Step Process:** Knowledge Creation Prompting consists of two main steps: 1) Initially asking the LLM a broad, informational question about a chosen subject (e.g., \"Tell me some infos about spiders\"). 2) Following up with a more specific task-oriented prompt once the LLM has generated and presented the initial information, which is now part of the active chat context.\n",
    "-   **Context Priming for Enhanced Relevance:** The initial general query serves to \"prime\" the LLM by loading relevant facts, terminology, and concepts about the subject into its immediate conversational context. This helps focus the LLM for subsequent, more detailed interactions, which is useful for data scientists who might first solicit an overview of a complex algorithm before asking for its specific applications.\n",
    "-   **Leverages Semantic Association:** The technique's effectiveness is attributed to the LLM's capacity for semantic association. The initially generated knowledge, when combined with the LLM's extensive pre-trained background knowledge, creates a richer and more focused contextual understanding, leading to more insightful and pertinent responses to later prompts.\n",
    "-   **Improves Subsequent Prompt Performance:** Once the initial knowledge base is established in the chat context, subsequent prompts (e.g., \"Write a blog article about spiders using 500 words,\" or \"Explain the lifecycle of a spider\") are more likely to yield higher quality, more detailed, and contextually appropriate outputs because the LLM has already activated and surfaced relevant information.\n",
    "-   **Simple yet Effective Technique:** The method is highlighted as being very easy to implement, typically requiring just one preliminary general question before the main, more specific query. Its simplicity makes it a practical and accessible tool for users to improve the outcomes of their prompts without needing intricate prompt engineering skills.\n",
    "-   **Implicit Expansion of Contextual Knowledge:** Even if the explicitly generated text doesn't cover every nuance of a topic, the process of generating this information helps the LLM to internally activate and connect to a wider array of related concepts within its background knowledge. This makes its \"effective\" knowledge on the topic for the current session more comprehensive and readily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Semantic Association in Knowledge Creation Prompting**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Semantic association refers to an LLM's capability to understand and interconnect words, phrases, and ideas based on their learned meanings and relationships derived from its vast training data. In Knowledge Creation Prompting, when the LLM generates initial information on a topic like \"spiders,\" it activates an internal network of related terms (e.g., \"arachnid,\" \"web,\" \"venom\"), facts, and broader concepts. This pre-activation makes subsequent prompts concerning \"spiders\" more effective because the relevant \"spider\" semantic field is already primed, highly accessible, and in focus within the LLM's attention mechanism.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** For a data scientist using an LLM for assistance, if they first prompt, \"Explain the core principles of Principal Component Analysis (PCA),\" the LLM's response will bring terms like 'dimensionality reduction,' 'variance,' 'eigenvectors,' and 'covariance matrix' into the immediate context. A subsequent prompt, such as \"How can PCA be used for feature engineering in a dataset with 100 correlated variables?\", will then benefit significantly. The LLM can leverage the already activated PCA-related semantics to provide a more targeted, nuanced, and technically sound answer, effectively connecting the general principles of PCA to the specific application of feature engineering.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** To better understand semantic association, one might explore concepts like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText), the attention mechanisms central to Transformer architectures (which underpin models like ChatGPT), and knowledge graphs (which represent relationships between entities). In the realm of prompting, this technique is related to effective context management and the general principle that providing relevant information upfront—even if it's AI-generated—positively influences the quality and relevance of subsequent outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** If you needed an LLM to help generate Python code for a specific data visualization using a less common library, how would you apply Knowledge Creation Prompting as a first step to ensure more accurate code generation? Provide a one-sentence explanation.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* I would first ask the LLM to \"Provide an overview of the [Less Common Library], including its main functionalities for data visualization and key syntax examples,\" to prime its context with information about that library before requesting the specific Python code.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the benefit of Knowledge Creation Prompting to a colleague who needs the LLM to draft several sections of a technical report on a niche scientific topic, using a simple analogy? Keep the answer under two sentences.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* It's like preparing for an interview on that niche topic: you'd first ask the LLM to \"tell you all about it\" (knowledge creation), so it \"studies up\" and has all the key info fresh in its \"mind\" when you then ask it to write the detailed report sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tree of Thoughts Prompting: How to negotiate your salary [10X better Output]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video details Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting, an advanced and highly effective technique that significantly enhances a Large Language Model's (LLM) problem-solving capabilities by structuring its reasoning process like a branching tree. ToT involves iteratively generating multiple diverse ideas or solutions (often from varied perspectives), evaluating these \"thoughts\" to identify the most promising paths, and then further expanding upon these selections in subsequent steps until a comprehensive and well-reasoned final output is achieved, proving particularly powerful for complex tasks such as developing a detailed negotiation strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Emulates Human Cognitive Problem-Solving:** Tree of Thought (ToT) prompting is designed to mirror the human approach to complex problem-solving, which involves exploring various potential solutions, assessing their viability, and systematically building upon the most promising ones. This structured exploration is crucial for LLMs to effectively tackle tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and planning.\n",
    "-   **Iterative Cycle of Generation, Evaluation, and Expansion:** The core mechanism of ToT is a multi-stage iterative process:\n",
    "    * **Generate:** Create multiple initial \"thoughts,\" solutions, or ideas in response to a problem, often by prompting for diverse perspectives.\n",
    "    * **Evaluate:** Assess the quality, relevance, or promise of these generated thoughts. This evaluation can be performed by the user or by prompting the LLM to self-critique.\n",
    "    * **Select & Expand:** Choose the most viable thought(s) (branches of the tree) and then generate further ideas, refinements, or next steps based on these selections. This cycle is repeated, deepening the exploration along chosen paths.\n",
    "-   **Significant Enhancement in Output Quality:** The video highlights research indicating that ToT can lead to dramatic improvements in an LLM's success rate and the quality of its outputs on complex tasks (the video mentions a paper claiming up to 74% improvement). This makes it a valuable technique for data scientists tackling challenging analytical problems requiring nuanced solutions.\n",
    "-   **Strategic Use of Diverse Perspectives:** A key tactic demonstrated within ToT is to prompt the LLM to generate initial sets of ideas from explicitly different viewpoints (e.g., a mathematical perspective, an emotional one, an expert negotiator's view). This encourages a broader initial exploration of the potential solution space and helps the LLM leverage its semantic association capabilities more effectively.\n",
    "-   **Interactive and Guided Reasoning Process:** ToT is often implemented as an interactive dialogue where the user actively guides the LLM's exploration. The user can select which \"branches\" of the thought tree to pursue, provide feedback, and inject new information or constraints at various stages, thereby combining human intuition with the LLM's generative power.\n",
    "-   **Demonstrated with Salary Negotiation:** The video provides a practical example of ToT by constructing a detailed salary negotiation strategy. The process starts with generating three broad approaches, evaluating them, selecting the \"expert negotiator\" path, then refining this into more specific strategies (e.g., \"strategic business partner\"), and finally generating concrete conversation starters and a full dialogue.\n",
    "-   **Ideal for Complex and Impactful Tasks:** While ToT is more labor-intensive and time-consuming than simpler prompting methods, its capacity to produce substantially superior, well-reasoned outputs makes it highly suitable for important, meaningful, and complex tasks where the quality of the outcome is critical (e.g., strategic planning, medical diagnosis assistance, intricate financial modeling).\n",
    "-   **Advanced Form of Multi-Path Exploration:** ToT is characterized as being conceptually similar to self-consistency (which also involves multiple generations) but significantly more advanced (\"on steroids\"). Unlike self-consistency which typically samples multiple independent answers, ToT involves a more structured, hierarchical, and deeper exploration of interconnected reasoning paths.\n",
    "-   **Leverages and Deepens Semantic Association:** By prompting for diverse viewpoints and iteratively building upon generated ideas, ToT encourages the LLM to form broader and deeper semantic associations. This enriches the context at each step and improves the coherence and relevance of the thoughts generated throughout the process.\n",
    "-   **Robust Final Output:** The final solution derived through a ToT process is not merely a direct answer to a query but the culmination of a deliberately explored, evaluated, and pruned tree of reasoning. This makes the end result more robust, justifiable, and often more creative than outputs from simpler prompting techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Iterative Exploration and Pruning in Tree of Thought**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** ToT distinguishes itself from single-pass generation by creating a \"tree\" structure where each node represents a \"thought\" — a partial idea, a potential solution, or an intermediate reasoning step. The core process involves:\n",
    "        * **Generating** multiple potential next steps, expansions, or alternative ideas from the current state (or node).\n",
    "        * **Evaluating** these generated options based on predefined heuristics, model-generated critiques, explicit user feedback, or a combination thereof.\n",
    "        * **Pruning** (discarding) less promising or irrelevant branches and **selecting** the most viable ones for further iterative expansion. This systematic exploration allows the LLM to consider various pathways, discard inferior ones, and progressively navigate towards a higher-quality and more refined solution.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** For data scientists, this process is analogous to complex problem decomposition, hypothesis generation and testing, or iterative model development. When faced with a challenging analytical goal (e.g., optimizing a complex system or understanding the drivers of a poorly understood phenomenon), a data scientist might mentally or formally explore several initial hypotheses (thoughts), evaluate their preliminary plausibility based on data (evaluation), select the most promising ones (selection), and then design further experiments or analyses for those chosen hypotheses (expansion). ToT enables an LLM to simulate this rigorous and methodical approach.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** This methodology shares conceptual similarities with various search algorithms used in artificial intelligence and computer science, such as breadth-first search, depth-first search, and particularly beam search (which keeps a limited number of best partial solutions at each step). Decision trees and game theory, especially in the context of games like chess or Go where players explore potential move sequences, also involve similar principles of exploring and pruning decision paths. Furthermore, concepts from reinforcement learning, where an agent learns optimal policies by exploring states, taking actions, and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties), resonate with the evaluative aspects of ToT.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **The Role of Diverse Perspectives in Generating Initial Thoughts**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Requesting the LLM to generate initial thoughts or solutions from distinct, clearly defined perspectives (e.g., logical, emotional, ethical, expert-based) is a powerful strategy within ToT. It compels the model to access and synthesize information from varied domains, styles of reasoning, or value systems. This helps to overcome the LLM's potential tendency to follow a default or singular line of thought and ensures a richer, more diverse set of initial branches in the \"tree,\" thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering novel or more effective solutions.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** In many real-world scenarios, such as strategic business decision-making, public policy formulation, or complex systems design, considering a problem from multiple stakeholder viewpoints or analytical angles is critical for a comprehensive understanding and robust solution. For data scientists, ToT allows them to prompt an LLM to simulate this multi-perspective analysis (e.g., analyzing a new technology's adoption from technical, economic, social, and ethical viewpoints), leading to more holistic, well-rounded, and contextually aware insights or recommendations.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** This technique is an advanced application of \"role-playing\" prompts, but integrated within a structured, multi-step reasoning framework. It also aligns with established brainstorming and creative problem-solving methodologies that encourage diverse viewpoints, such as De Bono's Six Thinking Hats, which assigns different roles or perspectives to participants to ensure thorough exploration of a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** Imagine you are tasked with using an LLM to devise a multi-faceted strategy for improving data literacy across a large organization. How would you structure the first two iterative steps (generation of initial diverse thoughts, and then evaluation/selection followed by generation of second-level thoughts) of a Tree of Thought process?\n",
    "    * *Answer:* Step 1 (Initial Generation): \"To improve data literacy across our organization, generate three distinct high-level strategic pillars, considering these perspectives: 1. A 'Training & Development' perspective focusing on skills, 2. A 'Tools & Access' perspective focusing on infrastructure, and 3. A 'Culture & Engagement' perspective focusing on mindset.\" Step 2 (Evaluation & Second-Level Generation): \"Assuming the 'Culture & Engagement' pillar is chosen as most foundational, now generate three specific, actionable initiatives that would fall under this pillar, considering the viewpoints of: a) an HR manager, b) a department head, and c) an enthusiastic data champion employee.\"\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** How would you explain the core advantage of Tree of Thought prompting over Chain of Thought prompting to a junior data analyst using an analogy of navigating a maze?\n",
    "    * *Answer:* \"Chain of Thought is like finding one path through the maze, hoping it's the exit. Tree of Thought is like sending scouts down multiple paths at each junction (generating diverse thoughts), getting reports back on which paths look promising (evaluation), and then sending more scouts down only those good paths (expansion), making it much more likely you'll find the best way out, not just any way.\"\n",
    "3.  **Extension:** Given that the \"evaluation\" of thoughts is a critical step in ToT, what specific LLM capabilities or prompting strategies could be employed to make this evaluation more rigorous and less reliant on subjective user judgment, particularly in a data science context where quantitative assessment is often preferred?\n",
    "    * *Answer:* To enhance evaluation, one could prompt the LLM to assess its generated thoughts against predefined quantitative or qualitative rubrics (e.g., \"For each proposed data analysis strategy, evaluate its potential impact on KPI X, its estimated resource cost, and its implementation feasibility on a scale of 1-5\"). Additionally, one could use few-shot prompting with examples of well-evaluated thoughts versus poorly-evaluated ones in a similar domain to guide the LLM's self-critique, or even prompt the LLM to generate Python code snippets to simulate or back-test the proposed data strategies against a sample dataset to get empirical feedback.\n",

    "# Overview of more Prompting Concepts and your homework\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "This video serves as a quick overview of further advanced prompting techniques, such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), ART, and APE, with the speaker noting that many are not essential for most users. The emphasis is placed on mastering a few core, effective methods already discussed—like short prompting, role prompting, and particularly Tree of Thought for complex, high-stakes tasks—as being more practical for achieving excellent results with LLMs. The speaker also mentions that Multimodal Chain of Thought will be explored in detail later, in conjunction with ChatGPT's vision capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Highlights\n",
    "-   **Core Techniques Are Often Sufficient:** The speaker reinforces the idea that the prompting techniques previously covered in depth (such as short prompting, role prompting, and Tree of Thought) are generally adequate for most users to achieve high-quality results from LLMs. This encourages data scientists to focus on mastering impactful methods rather than attempting to learn an exhaustive list of techniques.\n",
    "-   **Brief Mention of Other Advanced Techniques:** Several additional advanced prompting techniques are named, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG, or \"Richly Prompting\"), Automatic Reasoning and Tool use (ART), Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE), Active Prompt, Directional Stimulus Prompting, and ReAct. However, the speaker generally downplays the immediate necessity of many of these for typical user needs.\n",
    "-   **Tree of Thought Reiterated as a Top-Tier Method:** Tree of Thought prompting is highlighted again as a technique that \"delivers the best output across all the prompting techniques.\" It is specifically recommended for situations demanding highly specific, well-reasoned, and top-quality outcomes, such as strategizing for a salary negotiation.\n",
    "-   **Future Exploration of Multimodal Chain of Thought:** Multimodal Chain of Thought prompting is identified as a significant technique that will receive a more detailed \"deep dive\" later in the course, particularly when discussing the vision capabilities of ChatGPT. This signals its importance for models that can process and reason about multiple types of input (e.g., text and images).\n",
    "-   **Emphasis on Practical Application (\"Homework\"):** The speaker assigns a \"small little tiny piece of homework,\" encouraging viewers to actively apply their favorite prompting technique from the section to a real-world scenario. For instance, using the Tree of Thought method to ask ChatGPT how one can earn more money, reinforcing learning through practice.\n",
    "-   **Prioritizing Practical Mastery Over Exhaustive Knowledge:** The overarching message is that deep proficiency in a select few powerful prompting techniques is more valuable and practical than having a superficial understanding of numerous complex or \"fancy\" methods. This guidance helps users focus their learning efforts on what provides the most utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conceptual Understanding\n",
    "-   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**\n",
    "    1.  **Why is this concept important?** Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a crucial technique that addresses fundamental limitations of LLMs, such as their knowledge being static (frozen at the time of training) and their potential to \"hallucinate\" or generate factually incorrect information. RAG enhances LLMs by enabling them to first retrieve relevant information snippets from an external, often up-to-date and authoritative knowledge base (e.g., a company's internal documentation, a specific textbook, or a curated web source). This retrieved context is then provided to the LLM along with the user's prompt, allowing it to generate responses that are more accurate, current, and grounded in factual data.\n",
    "    2.  **How does it connect to real-world tasks, problems, or applications?** For data scientists and professionals, RAG is extremely valuable for building AI applications that require access to proprietary, domain-specific, or rapidly changing information that the base LLM was not trained on. Common applications include creating question-answering systems over internal company knowledge bases, developing customer support chatbots that use the latest product manuals and FAQs, generating summaries based on recent research papers, or providing financial advice based on current market data. It helps ensure that the LLM's outputs are not only coherent but also factually reliable and relevant to the specific context.\n",
    "    3.  **Which related techniques or areas should be studied alongside this concept?** To effectively implement or understand RAG, it's beneficial to study areas such as:\n",
    "        * **Vector Databases:** (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) for efficient storage and retrieval of text embeddings.\n",
    "        * **Document Indexing and Chunking:** Strategies for breaking down large documents into manageable pieces for embedding and retrieval.\n",
    "        * **Information Retrieval (IR) Algorithms:** Concepts beyond simple vector similarity, though modern RAG heavily relies on semantic search.\n",
    "        * **Embedding Models:** Understanding how text is converted into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "        * **LLM Fine-tuning:** As an alternative (or sometimes complementary) approach to instilling new knowledge, though RAG is often preferred for its ability to incorporate dynamic data without retraining the entire model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflective Questions\n",
    "1.  **Application:** The speaker emphasizes using Tree of Thought for impactful tasks. Describe a complex data interpretation challenge you've faced (or can imagine facing) where using Tree of Thought with an LLM could have helped you generate a more comprehensive and well-reasoned set of insights.\n",
    "    * *Answer:* Analyzing the root causes of a sudden, unexplained drop in user engagement for a software product could benefit from Tree of Thought by prompting the LLM to explore diverse potential factors (e.g., recent product changes, competitor actions, technical issues, external events) from various perspectives (e.g., user, technical, market), evaluate the likelihood of each, and then dive deeper into the most plausible causes to formulate actionable hypotheses.\n",
    "2.  **Teaching:** If you were explaining to a new team member why mastering a few core prompting techniques is better than superficially learning many (as per the video's advice), what analogy from a data scientist's daily workflow or toolkit would you use?\n",
    "    * *Answer:* I would compare it to mastering statistical modeling: it's far more effective to be highly proficient in implementing and interpreting a few versatile models like linear regression, decision trees, and k-means clustering for a wide range of problems, than to know the names of 50 obscure algorithms without the ability to apply any of them correctly or understand their outputs deeply.\n",
